The constellation will consist of a fleet of three spacecraft, and be both complementary and a follow-on to the upcoming deployment of the RADARSAT-2 mission. The primary purpose of the RCM is to provide C-Band data continuity for RADARSAT-2 users, as well as adding a new series of applications enabled through the constellation approach.\n\nThe main uses of RCM are expected to be in the areas of: maritime surveillance (ship detection, ice monitoring, and oil spill detection), disaster management, ecosystem monitoring.\n\nThe primary areas of interest are the landmass of Canada and its surrounding Arctic, Pacific and Atlantic maritime areas. The images and derived information are required to be provided to Canadian government users at frequent area coverage rates. Contrary to the earlier RadarSat missions, the imagery will not be available commercially.\n\nThe spacecraft Payload will consist of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor integrated with an Automated Identification System (AIS). The SAR Payload concept is a 2-panel deployable SAR antenna of length approximately 7 meters.","type":1,"wikiURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADARSAT_Constellation","typeName":"Earth Science","agencies":[{"id":16,"name":"Canadian Space Agency","abbrev":"CSA","countryCode":"CAN","type":1,"infoURL":null,"wikiURL":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Space_Agency","changed":"2017-02-21 00:00:00","infoURLs":["http://asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/","https://twitter.com/csa_asc","https://www.facebook.com/CanadianSpaceAgency","https://www.instagram.com/canadianspaceagency/","https://www.linkedin.com/company/9441729/"]}],"payloads":[{"id":441,"name":"RADARSAT Constellation Mission"}]}],"lsp":{"id":121,"name":"SpaceX","abbrev":"SpX","countryCode":"USA","type":3,"infoURL":null,"wikiURL":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX","changed":"2017-02-21 00:00:00","infoURLs":["http://www.spacex.com/","https://twitter.com/SpaceX","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtI0Hodo5o5dUb67FeUjDeA"]}},{"id":1343,"name":"Ariane 5 ECA | Eutelsat 7C & AT&T T-16","windowstart":"June 20, 2019 21:43:00 UTC","windowend":"June 20, 2019 23:30:00 UTC","net":"June 20, 2019 21:43:00 UTC","wsstamp":1561066980,"westamp":1561073400,"netstamp":1561066980,"isostart":"20190620T214300Z","isoend":"20190620T233000Z","isonet":"20190620T214300Z","status":1,"inhold":0,"tbdtime":0,"vidURLs":["http://www.arianespace.com/mission/ariane-flight-va248/"],"vidURL":null,"infoURLs":[],"infoURL":null,"holdreason":null,"failreason":null,"tbddate":0,"probability":-1,"hashtag":null,"changed":"2019-06-08 12:57:52","location":{"pads":[{"id":137,"name":"Ariane Launch Area 3, Kourou","infoURL":"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Europe_s_Spaceport/Europe_s_Spaceport2","wikiURL":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELA-3","mapURL":"https://www.google.com/maps/?q=5.239,-52.769","latitude":5.239,"longitude":-52.768,"agencies":[]}],"id":3,"name":"Kourou, French Guiana","infoURL":"","wikiURL":"","countryCode":"GUF"},"rocket":{"id":27,"name":"Ariane 5 ECA","configuration":"ECA","familyname":"Ariane","agencies":[],"wikiURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5","infoURLs":["http://www.arianespace.com/vehicle/ariane-5/"],"infoURL":"http://www.arianespace.com/vehicle/ariane-5/","imageSizes":[320,480,640,720,768,800,960,1024,1080,1280,1440,1920],"imageURL":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/launchlibrary/RocketImages/Ariane+5+ECA_1920.jpg"},"missions":[],"lsp":{"id":115,"name":"Arianespace","abbrev":"ASA","countryCode":"FRA","type":3,"infoURL":null,"wikiURL":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianespace","changed":"2017-02-21 00:00:00","infoURLs":["http://www.arianespace.com","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRn9F2D9j-t4A-HgudM7aLQ","https://www.facebook.com/ArianeGroup","https://twitter.com/arianespace","https://www.instagram.com/arianespace"]}},{"id":1112,"name":"Proton-M/Blok DM-03 | Spektr-RG","windowstart":"June 21, 2019 12:17:00 UTC","windowend":"June 21, 2019 12:17:00 UTC","net":"June 21, 2019 12:17:00 UTC","wsstamp":1561119420,"westamp":1561119420,"netstamp":1561119420,"isostart":"20190621T121700Z","isoend":"20190621T121700Z","isonet":"20190621T121700Z","status":1,"inhold":0,"tbdtime":0,"vidURLs":[],"vidURL":null,"infoURLs":[],"infoURL":null,"holdreason":null,"failreason":null,"tbddate":0,"probability":-1,"hashtag":null,"changed":"2019-06-06 17:13:30","location":{"pads":[],"id":10,"name":"Baikonur Cosmodrome, Republic of Kazakhstan","infoURL":"","wikiURL":"","countryCode":"KAZ"},"rocket":{"id":62,"name":"Proton-M/Blok DM-03","configuration":"-M/Blok DM-03","familyname":"Proton / UR-500","agencies":[],"wikiURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-M","infoURLs":[],"imageURL":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/launchlibrary/RocketImages/placeholder_1920.png","imageSizes":[320,480,640,720,768,800,960,1024,1080,1280,1440,1920]},"missions":[{"id":748,"name":"Spektr-RG","description":"Spektr-RG is a joint Russian-German observatory-class mission.
